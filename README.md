- 👋 Hi, I’m Tarvo
- 👀 I’m interested in Java Development and Technologies involved in it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JavaFX, And Front-end like HTML,CSS,JS, a bit of typescript and Angular. In 2025 I will also be learning UI/UX design or Software Testing (I have not decided yet).
- 💞️ I’m looking to Gain Practical Work experience and am Extremely open to learning new things, be it Code related or any other form, like languages, math, physics etc...
- 📫 You can reach me through email: Zethion1@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been Learning Coding on my own and Am currently trying to grasp a new language. Mainly speak Estonian or English (As a personal Opinion I would say both languages could be considered at a native level in both writing and spoken form).
  In my free time I like to Swim, work out, Stargaze or Learn new things.
