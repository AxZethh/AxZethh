- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been Learning Coding on my own and Am currently trying to grasp a new language. Mainly speak Estonian or English (As a personal Opinion I would say my English could be considered at a native level in both writing and spoken form).
  In my free time I like to Swim, work out, Stargaze or Learn new things.
